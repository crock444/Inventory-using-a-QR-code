# Inventory-using-a-QR-code
In this project, I have created an application that will scan a QR code with the student's first and last name and it is possible to write a complaint against him, which will be saved directly to FireBase. The data is saved by old users or creates a new user and assigns a written complaint to him.
This is how it looks visually:
